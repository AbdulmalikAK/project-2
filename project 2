In this second project , i deal with python language to build a code that could work with the Bike share data .

--HERE'S PART OF THE CODE --


 # TO DO: get user input for day of week (all, monday, tuesday, ... sunday)
 while True :
    day = raw_input("\n Enter name of the  day\n Monday,\n Tuesday,\n Wednesday,\n Thursday,"
            "\n Friday,\n Saturday,\n Sunday\n of week to filter by, or \"all\" to apply no day filter\n").lower()
        if day == "monday"
         or day =="tuesday"
         or day =="wednesday"
         or day =="thursday"
         or day =="friday"
         or day =="saturday"
         or day =="sunday"
         or day =="all" 
     break:
   else:
    print('Invalid input! . Plase try again :) ')
