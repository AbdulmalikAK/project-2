Over the past decade, 
bicycle-sharing systems have been growing in number and popularity in cities across the world. 
Bicycle-sharing systems allow users to rent bicycles on a very short-term basis for a price. 
This allows people to borrow a bike from point A and return it at point B, though they can also return it to the same l
ocation if they'd like to just go for a ride. Regardless, each bike can serve several users per day.

I was working on python code to answer the questions related to the BikeShare data system.
